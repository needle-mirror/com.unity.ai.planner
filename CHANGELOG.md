## [0.2.4-preview.2] - 2020-11-03

### Added
* List support (fixed size) in `ActionDefinition`: Contains, Length, Clear, `=`, `+=`, `-=`
* Temporary converters for convenience to convert old assets to new assets (will be removed in a future version)
* PlanningAgent trait to allow distinguishing between the entity the agent is on from other agents in action definitions
* Search to Plan Visualizer for filtering state data
* Support for a custom named "AI.Shared" AsmDef to be created to allow for additional dependencies; AI.Planner.Custom will utilize this as a dependency 
* Experimental C# API, allowing access to the planning modules 

### Changed

### Removed

* Local object data on DecisionController

## [0.2.2-preview] - 2020-01-16
### Fixed
* Fix filepath concatenation when generating code. 
* Fix loss of existing player loop when initializing the plan executor. 

## [0.2.1-preview] - 2019-12-20
### Added
* IsIdle to `IDecisionController` to reflect when the controller is not planning and not executing actions.
* UpdateStateWithWorldQuery to `IDecisionController` to allow updating the planner outside of action complete, such as where the plan is complete.
* BoundedValue validity checks (e.g. NaN, infinity) for when custom heuristics go awry.
* 32-bit integer field support for traits.
* Play back the EntityCommandBuffer (for state changes) on a separate thread instead of the main thread.
* Documentation for custom traits.
* Planner setting for scheduling multiple iterations of search at once.

### Changed
* Code now generates to the Packages directory as source.
* Expose discount factor in the PlanDefinition settings.
* Planner search and execution settings stay open when switching to play mode.
* Clean up public API by hiding unnecessary interfaces, structs, and fields.
* No longer block on previously scheduled planner iteration in the frame and simply wait until the job chain is complete.

### Removed
* Moveable.cs -- trait no longer uses `CustomTrait`, but instead gets generated from its `TraitDefinition`.

### Fixed
* Custom heuristic was not always getting picked up during code generation, so now the fully qualified name is serialized.
* Compilation upon switching to play mode is more reliable now. 
* Null reference exceptions when adding a `TraitComponent` initially with no traits added.
* Exception when dragging a GameObject with a missing component to an action callback of the `DecisionController`.
* Comparison of custom traits during state equality. 
* Improved performance while the plan executor waits for plan execution criteria.

## [0.2.0-preview] - 2019-12-02
### Added
* Planner search and execution settings under more options in `DecisionController` inspector.
* `ICustomTraitReward` for custom reward modifiers based on specific traits.
* Navigation module w/ traits, custom reward modifier, and simple navigation script.
* Help button in the inspector now links to documentation.

* Bounded heuristics for better search.
* Parallel selection and backpropagation algorithms.

### Changed
* Improve UI with re-orderable lists, better operand validation, and plan visualizer inspector.
* Improve workflow through `DecisionController`, `TraitComponent`, UI, callbacks, and world queries.
* Improve code compilation.
* Rename all mentions of DomainObject to TraitBasedObject.

### Removed
* `AgentDefinition`, since `PlanDefinition` supersedes it.
* `DomainObjectProvider`, since `TraitComponent` supersedes it.
* `BaseAgent`, since it is no longer necessary to create an Agent class.
* `IOperationalAction`, since `DecisionController` now handles this implicitly.

### Fixed
* Update template to avoid stack overflow in state data comparison.
* Null reference exceptions on adding a `TraitComponent` to a GameObject.
* Trait field renames.
