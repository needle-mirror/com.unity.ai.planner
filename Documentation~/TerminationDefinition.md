## Termination Criteria

For most applications, there is no need to continue planning beyond a point in which one or more termination conditions have been met. These conditions may represent the achievement of a desired goal or possibly the circumstances in which success has become impossible, such as when an agent has been defeated.

Each termination criteria is defined by a set of traits required to be on an object as well as conditional checks on the values of one or more properties on the object. For example, a termination criteria may be defined on objects with the "Health" trait when the "HitPoints" property reaches 0.
