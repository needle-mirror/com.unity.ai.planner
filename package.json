  "description": "The AI Planner includes authoring tools and a system for automated decision-making.\n\nAutomated planners are useful for:\n▪ Directing agent behavior either in a cooperative, neutral, or adversarial capacity\n▪ Auto-generating storylines or as an online story manager\n▪ Validating game design mechanics\n▪ Assisting in creating tutorials\n▪ Automated testing\n\nStart by defining a planning domain, composed of objects with which your agent may interact. Then, create definitions for what actions or decisions an agent may make. Once the planning problem is defined, the planner system will iteratively build a plan that converges to an optimal solution. Execute these plans by creating an agent script and game code to control your characters.",
