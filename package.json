  "description": "The AI Planner includes authoring tools and a system for automated decision-making.\r\n\r\nAutomated planners are useful for:\r\n▪ Directing agent behavior either in a cooperative, neutral, or adversarial capacity\r\n▪ Auto-generating storylines or as an online story manager\r\n▪ Validating game design mechanics\r\n▪ Assisting in creating tutorials\r\n▪ Automated testing\r\n\r\nStart by defining a domain definition of traits/enumerations. Then, create action definitions for what actions are possible in the domain. Once the planning problem is defined, the planner system will iteratively build a plan that converges to an optimal solution. Execute these plans by adding a decision controller to your agent.",
