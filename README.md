# AI Planner (com.unity.ai.planner)
The AI Planner includes authoring tools and a system for automated decision-making. 

Automated planners are useful for:
* Directing agent behavior either in a cooperative, neutral, or adversarial capacity
* Auto-generating storylines or as an online story manager
* Validating game design mechanics
* Assisting in creating tutorials
* Automated testing

Start by defining a domain definition of traits/enumerations. Then, create action definitions for what actions are possible in the domain. Once the planning problem is defined, the planner system will iteratively build a plan that converges to an optimal solution. Execute these plans by adding a decision controller to your agent.

## Required Software
Unity 2019.3
