# AI Planner (com.unity.ai.planner)
The AI Planner includes authoring tools and a system for automated decision-making, which includes:
* Directing agent behavior either in a cooperative, neutral, or adversarial capacity
* Auto-generating storylines or as an online story manager
* Validating game design mechanics
* Assisting in creating tutorials
* Automated testing

Start by defining a planning domain, composed of objects with which your agent may interact. Then, create definitions for what actions or decisions an agent may make. Once the planning problem is defined, the planner system will iteratively build a plan that converges to an optimal solution. Execute these plans by creating an agent script and game code to control your characters.

## Required Software
Unity 2019.2

## Documentation
Documentation for the AI Planner is available in [unpublished](Documentation~/index.md) and [published](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.ai.planner@0.1/) form.
